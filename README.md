# POPL Open Assessment - University of York
During my second year of university, this module focused on the principles of programming languages, and our open assessment involved solving some problems using  Prolog and Scheme.

## Prolog
The relevant section of this code focused on using prolog to encode a simplified London Underground system, made up of 21 stations across 5 different lines. My solution is by no means perfect, but I feel it's a strong representation of my abilities for a language I only had a few months experience with.

Broadly, the assessment required: stating which line(s) each of the stations were a part of; a check for whether a station exists; a lookup of which stations are adjacent; another check whether two stations are on the same line; a list of which stations are on a given line; a return of the number of lines a station is a part of; a lookup of the nearest non-interchange station; a lookup of all possible routes between two stations, and a lookup of the time taken to travel between two stations.

## Scheme
In contrast to the multiple-part nature of the first section, the Scheme
